# Fresh SDK

Develop Plugs for the Freshdesk platform.

## Prerequisite

The SDK requires [Java 8 runtime](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

## Installation

Extract the SDK distribution. Add to your PATH the extracted folder name:

    export FRSH_HOME=/extracted/path/fresh-sdk-1.0
    export PATH=$PATH:$FRSH_HOME/bin

Same command in Windows:

    FRSH_HOME=/extracted/path/fresh-sdk-1.0
    PATH=%PATH%;%FRSH_HOME%/bin

It is recommended to add the above commands to startup scripts in your system, so that you don't have to set this command every time you open a new shell.

## Updating SDK to the latest version

To check for, and install new versions, use the command:

    $ frsh-update

## Running

Once the PATH is set, in your commandline:

    $ frsh init-plug <proj-dir>

To create a new skeletal plug-project. To get help on the `frsh` command:

    $ frsh help
